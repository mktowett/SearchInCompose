# SearchInCompose
This Android project is a simple example of implementing a search view using Jetpack Compose. The project architecture follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern with the following components:

View: The UI components that are responsible for displaying the search view and search results to the user. These components are implemented using Jetpack Compose.

ViewModel: The ViewModel is responsible for handling the business logic of the search view. It exposes the search query and search results as LiveData or Flow, which the View can observe and update itself accordingly.

Model: The Model is responsible for handling the data retrieval and manipulation logic of the search view. It communicates with a data source such as a local database or a remote API and returns the search results to the ViewModel.
